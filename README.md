## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

to improve peformace, I've updated each file with the changes
for the main.js, I only made a few changes
Put a cache control on the file to use a local copy of the file for 600 secs
minified the .css files
put async in front of the google anylytics line
added my data and impage to the page.

for the index.html Modified a couple area
moved mutliple functions outside their loops, to improve performance
shrunk the pizza impage using tinypng.com website

Under updateposition, I've tried a couple different approaches and rem out what I didn't use.
changed how the randow pizza appear.
